a. client side - fetch api - this is fastest but not safe
b. server side - HttpClient - this is safest a little bit slower

		id
		name
		email
		body
3. create a new class in application - commentsDetails (anyname) and add 5 properties to it

4. add a variable to capture the data based on output expected
