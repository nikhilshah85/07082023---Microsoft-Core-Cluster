Consume WebAPI in MVC application 

we will use fetch api to consume the data 
	1. fetch api is a standard by W3C and ECMA for make api calls
	2. Is built in every modern browser
	3. fetch api - allows to work with promises - returns a promisse which will make sure your end users will always get a 
			response (success or error message) - rather than waiting
	4. works as a try catch block 
		here we have then and catch
	
	5. WebAPI are modern world web-services
		webservices were XML based SOAP messages - which are quiety heavy - not suitable for mobile devises/slow 		internet
		WebAPI are light weight, faster and JSON based
